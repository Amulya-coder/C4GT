# Code for GovTech (C4GT)

C4GT has been conceptualised as a summer coding program to create a community that can build and contribute to global digital public goods.
 - An opportunity for 3rd/4th year engineering students from Tier 1/2 campuses in India to experience the GovTech space
 - Organized annually over 3 months (mid May-mid Aug), anchored by Samagra with support from partners
 - There will be a set of GovTech problem statements every year for the participants to work on
 - Shortlisted participants will receive mentorship of leading practitioners in GovTech over 3 months

This repository is created to hold every documentation generated during C4GT.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Once the branch is merged to `main` branch, it will be deployed with the help of Github Actions at https://github.com/Code4GovTech/C4GT .
